                    Before I joined NXTwave, I had no idea about web development. <br/>And I have straggle a lot
            
                    After I had searched many websites to learn web development and that much interest I don't have<br/>
            
                    One day I've casually watched the web development video's on youtube and that time I noticed nextwave adventagements.<br/>
            
                    Then I began searching for NXTwave. And I have registered for a demo class at NXTwave. <br/>Also, I have connected to team members of Nextwave and they explained me the process of the program and also the job opportunities and all
            
                    In nxt wave they have types programs like...<br/>
            
                    1. smart <br/>
            
                    2. gunies <br/>
            
                    In smart it has some programs like ! <br/>
            
                    Frontend and backend development, as well as full stack development etc....<br/>
            
                    In gunsies it has some programs like ! <br/>
            
                    Data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc...<br/>
            
                    So finally, I have choose smart program .... <br/>
            
                    For the first day of class, I am so excited to listen to the classes ...
            
                    So it has a really good explanation, as well as everything else.<br/> And we can easily understand the concepts <br/>
            
                    And all of us have the option to choose different languages to listen to the classes ... like telugu and english. Also hind etc.... <br/>
            
                    After listening to the classes we have practiced each and everything so we will be perfect in that. <br/>
            
                    And they will give you some assignments. So we must complete those assignments on time. <br/>
            
                    As soon as you have completed all the courses, they will provide a certificate.. <br/>
            
                    So here's what I have to say about nextwave its excellent platform for learning <br/>
            
                    It has excellent teaching on this platform and also an experienced person. <br/>
            
                    Finally, I had concluded that i have choosed the right platform like this and I'm so grateful to be part of nxtwave.<br/>
            
                    Special thanks to my parents for joining in the next wave.....<br/>
